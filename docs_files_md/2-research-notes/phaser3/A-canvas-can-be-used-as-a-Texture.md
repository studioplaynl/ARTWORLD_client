**addGLTexture(key, glTexture [, width] [, height])**

Takes a WebGL Texture and creates a Phaser Texture from it, which is added to the Texture Manager using the given key.

This allows you to then use the Texture as a normal texture for texture based Game Objects like Sprites.

If the width and height arguments are omitted, but the WebGL Texture was created by Phaserâ€™s WebGL Renderer and has glTexture.width and glTexture.height properties, these values will be used instead.

This is a WebGL only feature.

**addRenderTexture(key, renderTexture)**

Adds a Render Texture to the Texture Manager using the given key. This allows you to then use the Render Texture as a normal texture for texture based Game Objects like Sprites.

renderTexture Phaser.GameObjects.RenderTexture
